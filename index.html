    <p>I enjoy side projects and put my all into them. I am usually slammed but if you have a good idea, I would love to be apart of it.</p>

      <h2>So this is whats up...</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Lambda as a full-stack Web Dev and immediately got hired at Google as a Junior Developer. While there I finished my degree BS in Computer Science and was promoted to Senior Software Engineer. Shorty after I decided to test the waters as a Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin while finishing up my Masters in Mechanical Engineering, which I enjoyed for some time. Eventually I decided I wanted to be an asset to smaller companies, start-ups and non-profits, I wanted to part of an organization that gave back to the people (and be outside more). I have been hired and volunteered at places like ADRA, Net Hope and World Vision where I was able to use my skills to more closely help people with everyday problems in their current situations.  </p>
